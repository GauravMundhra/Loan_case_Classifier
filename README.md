# Loan_case_Classifier

In this project, I have build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

Used the following algorithms to build models:

k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these were applicable:

Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass
